## Core Values Exercise

**Name:** Guess the word

**Rules:** Split into two teams. Have everyone sit down in front of a whiteboard. Pick one person from any team and make them sit with their back to the whiteboard. Write a word from the word list below. Every round, announce the theme. Then, their team must use words **that are not verbally similar to the written word** to help the guesser guess the word. The words that the team uses also cannot contain the word to be guessed inside them and cannot be fragments of the word to be guessed. There will be a thirty second timer for each guesser. If a guesser guesses the word correctly, their team gets a point. 5 rounds will be played and whichever team has the most points win. In case of a tie, there is no tiebreaker.
