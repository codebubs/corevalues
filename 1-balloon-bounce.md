## Core Values Exercise

**Name:** Balloon bounce

**Rules:** Bounce the balloon except everyone must use a different body part. For example, Person A hits the balloon with their hand, Person B hits it with their chest, Person C hits it with their legs, and so on.

**Note:** This is not a very complex idea or activity, and the main purpose is to understand how the core values activities will look and be executed.

**Rubric:**

| Name         | Weight         | Description (ask yourself) |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Teamwork | 2.0 | How well did you work as a team?            |
| Innovation | 1.5                 | Did you think of new ideas that helped you? |
| Inclusion | 1.5              | Did you include everyone? |
| Execution | 1.0 | Did you try your best? |
| Fun | 0.5 | Did you try to enjoy the activity? |

**Scoring Method:** First, everyone scores themselves. Then, both coaches provide their score as the final score which does not consider the participators' scoring. The final score, including the score of each category, can be used as a benchmark for the next activity in two weeks.

**Roles:**

| Name         | # of people         | Description              |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
